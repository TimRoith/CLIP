# CLIP
This repository provides an implementation of the <it>CLIP<it> algorithm for Lipschitz regularization of neural networks, proposed in <b>CLIP: Cheap Lipschitz Training of Neuronal Networks</b> [1].
Feel free to use it and please refer to our paper when doing so.

## Prerequistes
Our code is implemented python and utilizes PyTorch https://pytorch.org/ (see also their git https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
