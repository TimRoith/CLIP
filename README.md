# CLIP
In a few days this repository will provide an implementation of the *CLIP* algorithm for Lipschitz regularization of neural networks, proposed in **CLIP: Cheap Lipschitz Training of Neuronal Networks** [1].
Feel free to use it and please refer to our paper when doing so.

## Prerequistes
Our code is implemented python and utilizes PyTorch https://pytorch.org/ (see also their git https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
